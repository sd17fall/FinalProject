# FinalProject - Final Project for Software Design - Fall 2017 - Olin College of Engineering


### Description:
Bipedal systems are interesting to model. Our team is very interested in understanding the mechanics and underlying concepts within an evolutionary algorithm. We created a bare-bone bipedal structure using an evolutionary algorithm, rendered a simulation of it in a 2D environment, and tested the time the generation can remain on its feet.

### Authors:
Victor Bianchi, Isabel Blancett, Subeen Kim, Shreya Rangarajan


### Getting Started:
1. Download pygame
2. Make sure you have python3 installed
3. Fork and clone the repository
4. To run the program, type "python evolve.py" in the terminal window and watch the bipedal get better at walking overtime

### Usage:
The code will run automatically when you type in the terminal window and you will see a bipedal walk along a terrain. You can change the "roughness" of the terrain in the files and see if the bipedal evolves to get better at walking along the rough terrain.
