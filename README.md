# FinalProject - Final Project for Software Design - Fall 2017 - Olin College of Engineering


### Description:
Bipedal systems are interesting to model. Our team is very interested in understanding the mechanics and underlying concepts within an evolutionary algorithm. We created a bare-bone bipedal structure using an evolutionary algorithm, rendered a simulation of it in a 2D environment, and tested the time the generation can remain on its feet.
